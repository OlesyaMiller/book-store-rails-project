Welcome to my AI Book Shop App!

This application lets a user search for a book by genre and purchase it if the user has enough credit. A cool thing to note is that user can register as a customer or an admin. This way such features as adding books to the colection and updating prices will only be accesible to admin. Since the project has not been deployed yet here is the demo link - https://youtu.be/2LRvOzW5RLo

The app uses 2.6.1 ruby version and Rails 6.0.4.1

To be able to run the app, first install all the dependencies, including the database, by running 'bundle install'.

Next, start the server by running 'rails s' command. Once you have the server running, go to http://localhost:3000 and enjoy the app!
